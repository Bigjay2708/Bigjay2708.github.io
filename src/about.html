                        Hello! I'm Jason Wells, and my interest in coding has been a part of me for as long as I can remember. Ever since I first encountered technology, I've been captivated by the endless possibilities that programming offers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a student in the MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN program, and I'm also expanding my knowledge through Udemy.com. I'm fascinated by both front-end and back-end technologies, building a strong foundation to succeed in the tech industry. My journey has been all about mastering a wide range of skills, from crafting intuitive user interfaces to developing efficient server-side applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my studies, I've refined my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. I'm excited to dive into advanced coursework in React, MongoDB, Express, and other cutting-edge technologies. Solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries of innovation is what I thrive on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring technology, camping, hiking, kayaking, jamming to music, staying fit, and spending quality time with my family. These hobbies keep me grounded and inspire my creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm committed to using my skills to create impactful, user-centric web solutions. As I continue to grow and learn in this ever-evolving field, I'm eager to contribute to projects that make a real difference in the digital world.
                    </p>
